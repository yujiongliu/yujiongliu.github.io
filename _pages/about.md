I just obtained my Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering at Virginia Tech and working under the direction of Prof. [Pinhas Ben-Tzvi](http://www.rmlab.org/bt.html). My current research is on developing and controlling novel legged robots with serpentine robotic tails, just as how animals use their tails in nature.

My research interests mostly lie in the area of biologically-inspired robotics, including novel mechanism developments, mechatronics, system integration, dynamic modeling, and control of such systems. Particularly, I am very interested in the motion control problems in animal kingdom, which exhibits highly agile, dexterous, and versatile motions that involve rich environmental contacts and model uncertainties.

Before joining in the [Robotics and Mechatronics Lab](http://www.rmlab.org/) at Virginia Tech, I obtained a M.S. in Applied Mathematics from University of Minnesota Duluth and a M.S. in Robotics from Harbin Institute Technology, where I mainly worked on developing novel kinematic models and controllers for parallel robots.
