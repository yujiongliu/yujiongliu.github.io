I am a PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Virginia Tech and working under the direction of Prof. [Pinhas Ben-Tzvi](http://www.rmlab.org/bt.html). My current research is on developing and controlling legged robots with serpentine robotic tails, just as how animals use their tails in nature. An overview of this idea could be found in a recently published [article](https://www.asme.org/topics-resources/content/engineers-could-put-tails-on-robots)  on [ASME Mechanical Engineering Magazine](https://www.asme.org/membership/membership-benefits/mechanical-engineering-magazine).

My research interests mostly lie in the area of biologically-inspired robotics, including developing novel mechanisms, design and manufacturing, mechatronics and systematic integration, modeling, and control of such systems.

Before joining in the [Robotics and Mechatronics Lab](http://www.rmlab.org/) at Virginia Tech, I obtained a M.S. in Applied Mathematics from Uniersity of Minnesota Duluth and a M.S. in Robotics from Harbin Institute Technology, where I mainly worked on developing novel kinematic models and controllers for parallel robots.
