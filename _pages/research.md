## Using Serpentine Robotic Tails to Enhance the Agility, Dexterity, and Versatility of Legged Robots

This research is inspired by the biological observations that animals frequently use their serpentine tails to help the agile and dexterous motions, such as those exhibited by [monkeys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqzVI0CSKCU), [cheetahs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJMJryKXjkg), [kangaroo rats](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaGQQ-yX1sA&t=1s), etc. The ultimate goal of this research is to understand the fundamental principles behind these observations and apply these findings on robotics. This includes answering three key questions: (1) what are the functionalities of the serpentine tail on legged locomotion? (2) how do the animals control their tail motion? and (3) how could we learn from these findings and enhance the agility, dexterity, and versatility of existing legged robots?

## Buttons

Make any link standout more when applying the `.btn` class.

## Notices

**Watch out!** You can also add notices by appending `{: .notice}` to a paragraph.
{: .notice}

## HTML Tags

### Address Tag

<address>
  1 Infinite Loop<br /> Cupertino, CA 95014<br /> United States
</address>

### Anchor Tag (aka. Link)

This is an example of a [link](http://github.com "Github").

### Abbreviation Tag

The abbreviation CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets".

*[CSS]: Cascading Style Sheets

### Cite Tag

"Code is poetry." ---<cite>Automattic</cite>

### Code Tag

You will learn later on in these tests that `word-wrap: break-word;` will be your best friend.

### Strike Tag

This tag will let you <strike>strikeout text</strike>.

### Emphasize Tag

The emphasize tag should _italicize_ text.

### Insert Tag

This tag should denote <ins>inserted</ins> text.

### Keyboard Tag

This scarcely known tag emulates <kbd>keyboard text</kbd>, which is usually styled like the `<code>` tag.

### Preformatted Tag

This tag styles large blocks of code.

<pre>
.post-title {
  margin: 0 0 5px;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 38px;
  line-height: 1.2;
  and here's a line of some really, really, really, really long text, just to see how the PRE tag handles it and to find out how it overflows;
}
</pre>

### Quote Tag

<q>Developers, developers, developers&#8230;</q> &#8211;Steve Ballmer

### Strong Tag

This tag shows **bold text**.

### Subscript Tag

Getting our science styling on with H<sub>2</sub>O, which should push the "2" down.

### Superscript Tag

Still sticking with science and Isaac Newton's E = MC<sup>2</sup>, which should lift the 2 up.

### Variable Tag

This allows you to denote <var>variables</var>.
