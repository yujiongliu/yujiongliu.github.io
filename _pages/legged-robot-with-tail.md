Our research path on this direction mainly consists of two branches: one theoretical branch that focuses on using dynamics and control theory to understand the tail-involved legged locomotion problem, and one empirical branch that focuses on developing legged robots with a serpentine robotic tail and using hardware to practically verify the theoretical findings. We have proposed that with a serpentine robotic tail onboard, the legged robot may be able to perform some unique functionalities.

At present, on the theoretical side, we have created general dynamic models for both the quadruped and biped cases, with either an articulated tail or a continuum tail. We have also developed motion controllers based on the classical feedback linearization-based control and the numerical optimal control, to coordinate the leg motion and the tail motion. Some of the simulations are shown here.

For bipedalism (using a kangaroo rat model as an example), a serpentine tail is controlled to help the kangaroo rat to adjust its airborne posture, stabilize its locomotion through environmental contacts, and recover itself from falling.

For quadrupedalism (using a reduced complexity quadruped robot RCQt as an example), a serpentine tail is controlled to help the quadruped robot to adjust its airborne posture and change its heading direction (maneuvering).

On the empirical side, we have also developed several hardwares, including robotic tails (see the [RML Tail](/research/rmltail) and the [Rigitail](/research/rigitail)) and quadruped robots. Here shows one conceptual design for the tailed quadruped robot and one existing quadruped robot prototype.
