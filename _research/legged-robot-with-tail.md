Our research path on this direction mainly consists of two branches: one theoritical branch that focuses on using dynamics and control theory to understand the tail-involved legged locomotion problem, and one empirical branch that focuses on developing legged robots with a serpentine robotic tail and using hardware to practically verify the theoritical findings.

At present, on the theritical side, we have created general dynamic models for both the quadruped and biped case, with either an articulated tail or a continuum tail. We have also developed motion controllers based on the classical feedback linearization-based control and the numerical optimal control, to coordinate the leg motion and the tail motion. Some of the simulations are:

On the empirical side, we are also developing hardwares, including robotic tails and quadruped robots. Here are some existing prototypes.
